# eCFR Project

## Overall goal:
To create a simple website to analyze Federal Regulations to allow for more digestable and actionable insights to be made on potential deregulation efforts across the government.

## Project Instructions:
- Write code to download the current eCFR data, store the data server-side, create APIs that can retrieve the server-side stored data, and provide a UI to analyze it for items such as word count per agency, historical changes over time, and a checksum for each agency. 
- Only implement analysis that would provide meaningful information to the user.
- Please add at least one of your own custom metrics that you believe may help inform decision making more effectively.

## Requirements for Submission:
- Submit a zipfile containing the source code.
- They strongly prefer submissions with no more than 1200 lines of code (excluding tests and autogenerated code).
- Test the zip file to make sure it can be unzipped before you send it.

## Provide Feedback on the Assignment:
- Any comments I may want to add on how my expertise/skillsets fit this assessment.
- Duration it took me to complete it.
- Link to frontend, if applicable.
- Screenshots of your UI.
